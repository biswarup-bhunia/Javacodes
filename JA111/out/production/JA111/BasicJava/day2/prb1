So in java the basic difference between static variable and not static variable is

Static variable are refer to the class where non static variable are not.
static variable are access by class name where of accessing the non static variable we have to use
object.
static variable are load on the time of class load where non static variable are not.

Static variable are like class variable but nonstatic are like local variable by using object.
