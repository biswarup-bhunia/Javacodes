When should you use LinkedList over ArrayList?

LinkedLists are better when we need to manipulating the list
(adding & deleting) and ArrayLists are better when  we try to do
just accessing the list after creating it.
LinkedLists might be better if we adding a lot
of element one at a time.

LinkedList is faster when we insert or
delete an element from somewhere other than the end.

ArrayList has to literally copy its internal array up
to the point of insertion/deletion, add or remove the
element, copy the rest of the internal array and
then make the array copy the internal array.
This uses more CPU and adds more garbage collection
when the old internal array is GCed.

ArrayList is faster at getting an element at some
index because internally it's just an array,
so when we need call get(i) it simply returns the
element at that : array[i].
