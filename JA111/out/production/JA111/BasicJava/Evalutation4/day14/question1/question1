Explain the difference between ArrayList and LinkedList.

1.ArrayList internally uses a dynamic array to store its elements.
LinkedList uses Doubly Linked List to store its elements.

2.ArrayList is slow as array manipulation is slower.
LinkedList is faster being node based as not much bit shifting required.

3.ArrayList implements only List.
LinkedList implements List as well as Queue. It can acts as a queue as well.

4.ArrayList is faster in storing and accessing data.
