Multiple Inheritance is a feature of an
object-oriented concept, where a class can inherit
properties of more than one parent class.
The problem occurs when there exist methods with
the same signature in both the superclasses and
subclass. On calling the method, the compiler
cannot determine which class method to be called
and even on calling which class method gets the
priority.
