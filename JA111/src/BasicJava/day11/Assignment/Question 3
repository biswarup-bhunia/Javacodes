Explain the difference between abstract class and interface.

Ans -
     1.An abstract class can contain both abstract and non-abstract methods.
     but Interface contains only abstract methods.

     2.An abstract class can have all four; static, non-static and final, non-final variables.
     but Interface have only final and static variables are used.

     3.To declare abstract class abstract keywords are used.
     But for  interface can be declared with the interface keyword.

     4. Abstract supports multiple inheritance.
     but Inheritance does not support multiple inheritance.

    5. The keyword ‘extend’ is used to extend an abstract class
    for extended inheritance we use implement.
