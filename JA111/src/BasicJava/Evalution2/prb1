Explain the difference between == operator and equals() method
with a code example.

So, basically the main difference between == and equals() that is
1. == is an operator but equals() is a method in java.
2. == is used to compare the referred values and objects but other hand equals() is
to compare the actual content of the object.
3. In == operator it used to check the memory address of the object that is point
to the same location or not. But in equals() method compare the contents of the object
like that the charter is string or not same as integer value is numeric or not.
4.equals() method and can be overridden but == can't.
