Part 1.
        String immutable means that once the object has been assigned to a variable
        ,we can't update the reference and also can't mutate the internal state.

Part 2.
        Advantages of immutable strings
            1. It automatically makes the String thread safe since
            they won't be changed when accessed from multiple threads.
            2. It's doing a very good memory management.
            3. It is easier to design, implement.
            Disadvantages of immutable strings
            1.It require a separate object for each distinct value
            which results in creation too many new objects and performing
            deep copies.
