Is there any difference between creating a string with and without a new operator?
        Explain with an example.

Ans- Yes of course there are a difference
        So when ever a new keyword get on java it will create a space called heap area on our ram
        and store the variable and there value there.
        But when we create a string using String class it store in string pool.

        So the address of same string same value are different.
