What is the difference between final and finally. Write the code for
the same


Ans :-
1. When we need to restricate our variable, method or class at that time we
use final
but finally is a block when we handling exception through try catch
we use it. It print will always print if my code run through try or catch.

2.Final keyword is used upon the class,method and variables.
where as finally always used to catch exception handling.

3. Final method is executed only when we call it. where as
finally block is executed as soon as the try/catch block is executed.

public class FinalExa {

}
