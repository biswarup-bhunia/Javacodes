Explain the four pillars of object-oriented programming.

ans-
    So basically java is object oriented programming language which have
    four pillars . Those are
    1.Encapsulation
    2.Abstraction
    3.polymorphism
    4.Inheritance

    1.Encapsulation - It is basically a class which have variable and
    method into it.
    2.Abstraction - It is a process of hiding the implement detailes like method and all and
    showing only functionality to user. Like a car. User can show the outer part but engine and all are
    hide.
    3.Inheritance - This is basically a method which takes something like variable, method from a other class.
    Simply means inherit something from parent.
    4.Polymorphism - Its basically the multiple forms of a class.
