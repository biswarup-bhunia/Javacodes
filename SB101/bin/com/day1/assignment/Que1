What is the Difference between Comparable and Comparator? Explain with examples.

We know that both are Interface only. both need to be override. And both use for sort.
But the main difference that if we need to do multiple compare in a collection then we use comparator implemented class
but in comparable we can compare a single statement only.


for exam

public class Student implements Comparable{

this is bean class
through this we can compare only the one method implementation.

Like if me need sort both student and marks then we can compare through it.


} 





public class StudentSortName implements COmparator{

this is the implementation class of the comparator Interface.
through here if we override 

void compareTo(){
}
 method then we can sort multiple things.

}
