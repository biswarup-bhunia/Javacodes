What is the Difference between the sleep and join method .

There is a difference between join() and sleep().
 join() will wait until the timeout expires or the thread
  finishes. sleep() will just wait for the specified amount 
  of time unless interrupted. So it is perfectly possible for 
  join() to return much faster than the specified time.
