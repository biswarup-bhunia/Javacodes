What if we call Java run() method directly instead start() method?

If run() method is called directly instead of start()
 method in Java code, run() method will be treated as a 
 normal overridden method of the thread class (or runnable 
 interface). This run method will be executed 
within the context of the current thread, not in a new thread.


In short term it will be treated as single thread.
