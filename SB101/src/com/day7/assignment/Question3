What do you mean by a Race condition, How to solve a race condition, give a proper
example

A simple example of a race condition is a light switch.
 In some homes, there are multiple light switches connected
to a common ceiling light. When these types of circuits are
used, the switch position becomes irrelevant. If the light 
is on, moving 
either switch from its current position turns the light off.
