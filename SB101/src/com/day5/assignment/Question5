) Differentiate between the Thread class and Runnable interface for creating a
Thread?

1
Basic 
Thread is a class. It is used to create a thread 
Runnable is a functional interface which is used to create a thread 
2
Methods
It has multiple methods including start() and run()
It has only abstract method run()
3
Create Object
 	Each thread creates a unique object and gets associated with it
Multiple threads share the same objects.
4
Memory 
More memory required 
Less memory required 
5
Limitation 
Multiple Inheritance is not allowed in java hence after a class extends Thread class, it can not extend any other class
If a class is implementing the runnable interface then your class can extend another class.
